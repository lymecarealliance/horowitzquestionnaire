# Horowitz Lyme-MSIDS Questionnaire

This repository contains structured data and documentation for the **Horowitz Lyme-MSIDS Questionnaire**, a tool developed by **Dr. Richard I. Horowitz** for assessing the likelihood of Lyme disease and related tick-borne illnesses.

## Contents

- **horowitz_questionnaire.md**: A detailed Markdown version of the questionnaire.
- **horowitz_questionnaire.yaml**: A structured YAML format for technical applications.
- **horowitz_questionnaire.json**: A structured JSON format for integrations and automation.
- **horowitz_scoring.py**: Python function to compute scores based on symptom input.
- **horowitz_scoring.js**: JavaScript function for score calculation, useful for web apps or bots.

## Purpose

The Horowitz Lyme-MSIDS Questionnaire is intended for informational use to help medical professionals and researchers understand symptom patterns associated with tick-borne diseases. It is **not** a diagnostic tool and should not replace professional medical advice.

## Repository Goals

- Provide clean, structured data for use in AI models, RAG bots, and healthcare systems.
- Offer scoring logic functions for developers to automate assessments.
- Support open collaboration on improving Lyme disease awareness and assessment tools.

## Usage

You can use these files to:
- Integrate with AI tools like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
- Analyze and process Lyme disease symptoms and risk factors.
- Build interfaces or automated assessments based on the questionnaire logic.
- Use provided Python and JavaScript functions to calculate questionnaire scores programmatically.
